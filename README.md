# Mantle Tip Jar

A decentralized application (dApp) that enables content creators to receive cryptocurrency tips from their fans through an embeddable widget. The core innovation is gasless tipping for fans, achieved through meta-transaction relaying on the Mantle network.

## Features

- **Gasless Tipping**: Fans can tip creators without paying gas fees through meta-transaction relaying
- **Creator Dashboard**: Complete dashboard with earnings overview and recent tips table
- **Embeddable Widget**: Interactive tip modal with wallet connection and amount selection
- **Settings Management**: Dynamic embed code generation with copy-to-clipboard functionality
- **Onboarding Flow**: Complete profile setup and payout method configuration
- **Mantle Network**: Built for Mantle testnet with low-cost transactions

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 0: Static UI Foundation (Complete)
All core pages and components have been implemented with static UI and full navigation:

#### Pages
- **Landing Page** (`/`): Split-screen design with feature highlights and Clerk SignUp component
- **Complete Profile** (`/onboarding/complete-profile`): Avatar upload, name, website, and about sections with navigation to payout setup
- **Payout Method** (`/onboarding/payout-method`): Wallet connection interface with Mantle network info and navigation to dashboard
- **Creator Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Balance display, recent tips table, withdraw functionality, and navigation to settings
- **Settings** (`/dashboard/settings`): Embed code generator with copy functionality, live preview, and navigation back to dashboard
- **Embed Widget** (`/embed/[creatorId]`): Interactive tip modal with amount selection and wallet connection simulation

#### UI Component Library (Shadcn/ui)
Complete implementation of all required UI components:
- **Button**: Variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link) with size options and asChild prop support
- **Input**: Styled form input with focus states and accessibility features
- **Textarea**: Multi-line text input with proper styling and focus states
- **Avatar**: Profile picture component with image and fallback support using Radix UI
- **Card**: Container components (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter)
- **Table**: Complete table system (Table, TableHeader, TableBody, TableRow, TableHead, TableCell, TableCaption)
- **Dialog**: Modal system (Dialog, DialogTrigger, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogDescription) using Radix UI
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons throughout the interface

#### Navigation & User Flow
- **Complete Navigation**: All pages properly linked with Next.js Link components
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress tracking in onboarding flow
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Interactive Elements**: Functional buttons, modals, and form interactions

#### Features Implemented
- Mock data for dashboard tips and balance display
- Interactive tip modal with preset amounts (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 MNT) and custom input
- Clipboard functionality for embed code copying with success feedback
- Dynamic embed code generation with creator ID
- Wallet connection simulation with status indicators
- USD conversion display for MNT amounts (mock rate: 1 MNT = $0.65)
- Form validation and user feedback throughout the application

### ✅ Phase 1: Dynamic Frontend & Authentication (Complete)
Authentication and Web3 infrastructure has been fully implemented:

#### Authentication System
- **Conditional Clerk Integration**: ConditionalClerkProvider handles authentication with build-time safety
- **Build-Safe Authentication**: Automatically detects invalid/placeholder keys and gracefully degrades during builds
- **Protected Routes**: Async middleware protecting `/onboarding/*` and `/dashboard/*` routes with `await auth.protect()`
- **Public Routes**: Landing page (`/`), embed widgets (`/embed/*`), and API routes (`/api/relay-tip`) remain accessible
- **Sign-up Flow**: Clerk SignUp component integrated in landing page with custom styling
- **Route Matching**: Uses `createRouteMatcher` for efficient public route detection

#### Web3 Infrastructure
- **Wagmi Configuration**: Complete Web3 provider setup with Mantle Testnet support
- **Network Configuration**: Mantle Testnet (Chain ID: 5003) with RPC endpoint configuration
- **Wallet Connectors**: Support for injected wallets, MetaMask, and WalletConnect
- **Query Client**: TanStack Query integration for efficient data fetching and caching

#### Provider Architecture
```typescript
// Simplified provider structure with ClerkProvider always wrapping the application
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body className={inter.className}>
          <Web3Provider>
            {children}
          </Web3Provider>
        </body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

#### Environment Configuration
- **Clerk Keys**: Authentication keys for development and production
- **Web3 Settings**: Mantle RPC URL and chain ID configuration
- **Redirect URLs**: Post-authentication routing to onboarding flow

#### Build Configuration
- **Static Optimization Disabled**: Configured to prevent Clerk authentication build errors
- **Server-Side Rendering**: All pages forced to server-side rendering with `forceSwcTransforms: true`
- **Static Generation Disabled**: `generateStaticParams: false` to avoid static generation conflicts with authentication

#### Authenticated Components
- **Dashboard Integration**: Dashboard page uses Clerk's `useUser` hook with proper loading and authentication states
- **Settings Page**: Fully integrated with Clerk authentication, generates dynamic embed codes using real user IDs
- **Landing Page**: Configured with `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent build-time Clerk errors with SignUp component
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Both settings page and landing page use dynamic rendering to ensure proper Clerk integration
- **User Session Management**: Real user data integration with hardcoded balance and tips data for development
- **Withdraw Simulation**: Console logging and alert-based withdrawal simulation for testing

### ⏳ Phase 1: Remaining Tasks
- Implement live wallet connection in tip modal with Wagmi hooks
- Build interactive tip flow with EIP-712 signing simulation
- Replace remaining mock data with user-specific information

### ⏳ Phase 2: Backend & Blockchain Integration (Planned)
- Smart contract development and deployment
- Meta-transaction relay service
- EIP-712 signature verification
- Live blockchain interactions

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript
- **Build Configuration**: Standalone output with optimized authentication handling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables and Shadcn/ui design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Utilities**: clsx and tailwind-merge for conditional styling
- **Authentication**: Clerk (integrated)
- **Web3**: Wagmi + Viem (integrated)
- **Smart Contracts**: Hardhat + Solidity (to be developed)
- **Network**: Mantle Testnet
